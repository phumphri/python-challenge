In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records
of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). 
Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. 

(Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
•	The total number of months included in the dataset
•	The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period
•	The average change in revenue between months over the entire period
•	The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
•	The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
